# DNA Sequence Analysis in Base R

This project analyzes DNA sequences, identifies open reading frames (ORFs), translates them into amino acids, and computes biochemical properties â€” all using **pure base R**, no external packages required.

## ðŸ§¬ Features

- Detects ORFs in all 3 frames (forward & reverse)
- Translates DNA to amino acid sequences
- Annotates amino acids by polarity, charge
- Outputs results to a readable `.txt` report
